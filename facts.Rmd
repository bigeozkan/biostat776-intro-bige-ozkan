title: "(Fun?) Facts"

* My favorite sport is skiing, which is sad, because in Turkey the ski season lasts at most 3 months. 
* After a year of taking virtual classes from overseas, I got used to the time difference of 7 hours between Istanbul and Baltimore. When I finally moved to Baltimore, it took me some time to adapt to a regular daytime routine.
* I will try to run the 10k at the Baltimore Running Festival (fun vs. funny, we will see)
* I have been in Baltimore for more than a month and I still haven't tried any crab dishes.
